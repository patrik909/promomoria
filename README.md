# PROMOMORIA

## Client-side

## Server-side

Name a phpmyadmin database to - promomoria
Then import the db.sql

change values in - mailCredentials.js, if your not using gmail, change line 27.
Please change line 141 too, otherwise i'll get the info about new user registered :)
The mail function doesn't really have any functionally atm, just giving the admin an notification about a new user. The user should be set to active = 0 in myphpadmin, but at the moment the user is activated already from the time user is registered..

Also add the folder uploads + artwork & tracks subfolder.
